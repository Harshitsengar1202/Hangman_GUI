 Hangman is a word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the 
other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters. A blank line is drawn for each letter in the 
word, and the player fills in the blanks with correct guesses. However, for each incorrect 
guess, a part of a “hangman” figure is drawn. The goal is to guess the word before the 
hangman is fully drawn.
